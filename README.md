                       └──── Learning Loop ←──────┘
```
### Get Started Fast

``` 
npx claude-flow@v3alpha init 
```

---
### Key Capabilities

🤖 **54+ Specialized Agents** - Ready-to-use AI agents for coding, code review, testing, security audits, documentation, and DevOps. Each agent is optimized for its specific role.

🐝 **Coordinated Agent Teams** - Run unlimited agents simultaneously in organized swarms. Agents spawn sub-workers, communicate, share context, and divide work automatically using hierarchical (queen/workers) or mesh (peer-to-peer) patterns.

🧠 **Learns From Your Workflow** - The system remembers what works. Successful patterns are stored and reused, routing similar tasks to the best-performing agents. Gets smarter over time.

🔌 **Works With Any LLM** - Switch between Claude, GPT, Gemini, Cohere, or local models like Llama. Automatic failover if one provider is unavailable. Smart routing picks the cheapest option that meets quality requirements.

⚡ **Plugs Into Claude Code** - Native integration via MCP (Model Context Protocol). Use claude-flow commands directly in your Claude Code sessions with full tool access.

🔒 **Production-Ready Security** - Built-in protection against prompt injection, input validation, path traversal prevention, command injection blocking, and safe credential handling.

🧩 **Extensible Plugin System** - Add custom capabilities with the plugin SDK. Create workers, hooks, providers, and security modules. Share plugins via the decentralized IPFS marketplace.

<summary>💰 <strong>Intelligent 3-Tier Model Routing</strong> — Save 75% on API costs, extend Claude Max 2.5x</summary>

Not every task needs the most powerful (and expensive) model. Claude-Flow analyzes each request and automatically routes it to the cheapest handler that can do the job well. Simple code transforms skip the LLM entirely using WebAssembly. Medium tasks use faster, cheaper models. Only complex architecture decisions use Opus.

**Cost & Usage Benefits:**

| Benefit | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| 💵 **API Cost Reduction** | 75% lower costs by using right-sized models |
| ⏱️ **Claude Max Extension** | 2.5x more tasks within your quota limits |
| 🚀 **Faster Simple Tasks** | <1ms for transforms vs 2-5s with LLM |
| 🎯 **Zero Wasted Tokens** | Simple edits use 0 tokens (WASM handles them) |

**Routing Tiers:**

| Tier | Handler | Latency | Cost | Use Cases |
|------|---------|---------|------|-----------|
| **1** | Agent Booster (WASM) | <1ms | $0 | Simple transforms: var→const, add-types, remove-console |
| **2** | Haiku/Sonnet | 500ms-2s | $0.0002-$0.003 | Bug fixes, refactoring, feature implementation |
| **3** | Opus | 2-5s | $0.015 | Architecture, security design, distributed systems |

**Benchmark Results:** 100% routing accuracy, 0.57ms avg routing decision latency

</details>

<details>
<summary>📋 <strong>Spec-Driven Development</strong> — Build complete specs, implement without drift</summary>

Complex projects fail when implementation drifts from the original plan. Claude-Flow solves this with a spec-first approach: define your architecture through ADRs (Architecture Decision Records), organize code into DDD bounded contexts, and let the system enforce compliance as agents work. The result is implementations that match specifications — even across multi-agent swarms working in parallel.

**How It Prevents Drift:**

| Capability | What It Does |
|------------|--------------|
| 🎯 **Spec-First Planning** | Agents generate ADRs before writing code, capturing requirements and decisions |
| 🔍 **Real-Time Compliance** | Statusline shows ADR compliance %, catches deviations immediately |
| 🚧 **Bounded Contexts** | Each domain (Security, Memory, etc.) has clear boundaries agents can't cross |
| ✅ **Validation Gates** | `hooks progress` blocks merges that violate specifications |
| 🔄 **Living Documentation** | ADRs update automatically as requirements evolve |

**Specification Features:**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Architecture Decision Records** | 10 ADRs defining system behavior, integration patterns, and security requirements |
| **Domain-Driven Design** | 5 bounded contexts with clean interfaces preventing cross-domain pollution |
| **Automated Spec Generation** | Agents create specs from requirements using SPARC methodology |
| **Drift Detection** | Continuous monitoring flags when code diverges from spec |
| **Hierarchical Coordination** | Queen agent enforces spec compliance across all worker agents |

**DDD Bounded Contexts:**
```

```

**Key ADRs:**
- **ADR-001**: agentic-flow@alpha as foundation (eliminates 10,000+ duplicate lines)
- **ADR-006**: Unified Memory Service with AgentDB
- **ADR-008**: Vitest testing framework (10x faster than Jest)
- **ADR-009**: Hybrid Memory Backend (SQLite + HNSW)

<summary><h2>🔧 Troubleshooting </h2></summary>


### Common Issues

**MCP server won't start**
```bash
# Check if port is in use
lsof -i :3000
# Kill existing process
kill -9 <PID>
# Restart MCP server
npx claude-flow@v3alpha mcp start
```

**Agent spawn failures**
```bash
# Check available memory
free -m
# Reduce max agents if memory constrained
export CLAUDE_FLOW_MAX_AGENTS=5
```

**Pattern search returning no results**
```bash
# Verify patterns are stored
npx claude-flow@v3alpha hooks metrics
# Re-run pretraining if empty
npx claude-flow@v3alpha hooks pretrain
```

**Windows path issues**
```powershell
# Use forward slashes or escape backslashes
$env:CLAUDE_FLOW_MEMORY_PATH = "./data"
# Or use absolute path
$env:CLAUDE_FLOW_MEMORY_PATH = "C:/Users/name/claude-flow/data"
```

**Permission denied errors**
```bash
# Fix npm permissions (Linux/macOS)
sudo chown -R $(whoami) ~/.npm
# Or use nvm to manage Node.js
```

**High memory usage**
```bash
# Enable garbage collection
node --expose-gc node_modules/.bin/claude-flow
# Reduce HNSW parameters for lower memory
export CLAUDE_FLOW_HNSW_M=8
export CLAUDE_FLOW_HNSW_EF=100
```

# 1. Backup existing data
cp -r ./data ./data-backup-v2

# 2. Update to V3
npm install claude-flow@latest

# 3. Run migration
npx claude-flow@v3alpha migrate --from v2

# 4. Verify installation
npx claude-flow@v3alpha --version
npx claude-flow@v3alpha hooks metrics
```

### Configuration Changes

```bash
# V2 (deprecated)
npx claude-flow init --mode basic

# V3 (new)
npx claude-flow@v3alpha init
npx claude-flow@v3alpha hooks pretrain  # Bootstrap learning
```

### API Changes
